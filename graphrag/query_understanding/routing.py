"""
Routing decisions for the GraphRAG pipeline.

A single pure function (`decide_routing`) maps the gatekeeper's analysis +
the current session memory + the raw user query to one of three modes:

    NO_RETRIEVAL  — skip Pinecone, entity extraction, and Neo4j entirely.
                    The LLM answers from session memory only.
    MEMORY_FIRST  — minimal vector backfill (3 chunks, no graph) for vague
                    queries that benefit from a tiny bit of clinical grounding.
    HYBRID_RAG    — full pipeline as configured per QueryType.

Why this exists: the gatekeeper returns intents (`diagnosis_query`,
`medication_query`, `treatment_query`, ...) that do not match the QueryType
enum exactly. The previous inline routing block fell through to
`QueryType.UNKNOWN` — whose config is `vector_top_k=15, graph_hops=1` —
so any unrecognized intent triggered full retrieval. This module fixes
that by giving `decide_routing` the final say on retrieval cost.
